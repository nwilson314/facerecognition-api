# Face Recognition Brain API
A RESTful server API for the Face Recognition app frontend using Express.


### Note
I am using the package bcrypt-nodejs for password authentication, however this package is no longer maintained. Since this project isn't actually meant to be deployed and it solves the issue of development on both Windows and Linux based platforms, I am still going to use it (rather than the original bcrypt/bcrypt.js options).
